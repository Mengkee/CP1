    To mitigate risk
    <div id="content">
      Nature: set up limitations on the policyholders who can take out the policy and the condition or amount of paying out the claim / surrender value.
      <ul>
        <li> Exclusion clause
        </li>
        <li> Initial underwriting
        </li>
        <li> Set up excess, maximum payout
        </li>
        <li> age limitation
        </li>
        <li> waiting period
        </li>
        <li> Apply age-related management charge to reduce mortality risk.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce initial allocation percentage
        </li>
        <li>Set minimum single premium to avoid large volume of small policies, thereby reducing risk of not meeting fixed and/or per-policy expenses.
        </li>
        <li>Increase surrender penalty applied to deter withdrawals
        </li>
      </ul>
      However, each of these may make the product less marketable.

  <div class="column middle" >
    To reduce premium rate / cost of benefit
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Weaken assumptions used in pricing basis
          <br>
          Particularly with regard to claim inception and termination rates.
          <br>
          But, increased risk of pricing assumptions not being borne out in practice, which will result in future losses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce profitability loading
          <br>
          Expectation of increased volumes offsetting reduced profit per case.
          <br>
          But, elasticity of demand may not be accurately understood and, thus, increases in volume may not be as expected.
          <br>
          Also, need to consider competitor response to lowering premiums, which may limit any expected increase in competitiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce underwriting costs
          <br>
          Saving can be passed on to policyholders in the form of lower premiums. But, claims experience is likely to worsen, which will negate any reduction in premiums.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement more stringent underwriting procedures
          <br>
          Should lead to lower claims inception rate and, thus, lower premiums.
          But, will increase decline rates and lengthen sales processes.
          Also, increased cost of underwriting may outweigh any premium reduction as a result of better risk
          targeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce claims outgo
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply limit on proportion of income protected, maximum age or maximum payment period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase exclusions applied and/or introduce longer deferred period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduce escalation of claims in payment
            </li>
            <li>
              These actions may reduce the marketability of the product, so that the reduction in premium rates achieved does not result in increased volumes of business sold.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement more stringent claims control processes
          <ul>
            <li>
              Decline more claims.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review existing claims on a more regular basis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offer long‐term claimants a lump sum final payment in lieu of a regular future income.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reputational risk and PRE considerations if claims philosophy not in line with policyholders
              expectations. Also, increased costs of new claims control measures will limit any reduction in
              premium rates.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce anti‐selection effect
          <ul>
            <li>
              Target only lower risk business (e.g. with regard to age, sex, occupation) to allow for lower risk margins.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sell product as rider benefit only (e.g. when purchasing a mortgage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Better training of sales teams to identify anti‐selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Effect regular policy reviews to identify over‐insurance.
            </li>
            <li>
              But, may lead to significant reduction in business volumes and any additional costs incurred will reduce possible premiums reductions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Pay less commission on sale
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lower incentive to sale may reduce overall business volumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Increase proportion of commission successfully clawed back in event of withdrawal.
            </li>
            <li>
              May also reduce incentive to sale and any increased administration costs associated with this may outweigh the benefits.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce on‐going expense loadings
          <ul>
            <li>
              Streamline processes to increase efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              But, may result in poor customer service and reputational risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cross‐subsidise from policies with higher premium rates to those with lower premium rates and/or between different distribution channels etc to increase competitiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
              But, creates risk that mix of business sold is different to that assumed, leading to future losses.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Invest funds held in assets with a higher expected return
          <ul>
            <li>
              Can reduce cost of future claims outgo.
            </li>
            <li>
              But, introduces greater uncertainty and mismatching risk. Also, need to consider whether any regulatory risk associated with such a mismatch.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reinsurance
          <ul>
            <li>
              Make more effective use of reinsurance arrangements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Typically, this will mean retain more risk (assuming that reinsurance premiums include profit loading for reinsurer).
            </li>
            <li>
              But, increased claims volatility will result from higher retained risk.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Guarantees
          <ul>
            <li>
              Remove/reduce the level of any guarantees in the policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduce or extend use of reviewable/renewable premiums.
            </li>
            <li>
              But, such steps are also likely to reduce marketability.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
