  <div class="column middle">

    <a href="#question_1_1">Costs of insurance products can be controlled</a>
    <br>
    Minimising the ongoing costs (i.e. in respect of both claims payments and expenses associated with such claims) is crucial in maintaining the profitability of in-force business.
    <br>
    One of the most successful methods of minimising costs on some non-life insurance contracts is the introduction of a no-claims discount (NCD) system
    <br>
    Policyholders are discouraged from making small claims as it may well mean that future premiums will rise.
    <br>
    With fewer claims, claim administration expenses are also reduced.
    <br>
    Similarly, the introduction of an excess in many non-life insurance policies can also achieve the same objectives.
    <br>
    possible drawbacks of such schemes: can lead to disputes with policyholders (e.g. if NCD is reduced when p/h is not at fault for claim, / if excess level or NCD system was not understood), high level of excess can reduce marketability.
    <br>
    In practice, other ways to manage ongoing costs include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        investigate potentially excessive and/or fraudulent claims ─ but, can create bad publicity if used too much
      </li>
      <li>
        review entitlement to ongoing benefits periodically ─ e.g. benefits provided on incapacity under an income protection policy can require ongoing proof of eligibility
      </li>
      <li>
        review terms and conditions for payment of future benefits (easier to do to new business, but not existing policies) ─ introduce exclusion clause for claims arising from terrorism, AIDS or pandemics (e.g. Swine Flu, SARS)
      </li>
      <li>
        introduce flexible charges ─ e.g. in unit-linked life insurance contracts, charges deducted can often be varied at the discretion of the company.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The company must ensure that the costs of any claim’s management scheme (either explicit or implicit – e.g. in terms of bad publicity) are consistent with any reduction in costs achieved (as a result of the claim management process).
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="#question_1_2">Costs of pension benefits can be controlled</a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        minimising guaranteed benefits ─ e.g. in a DB scheme, increases to pensions in payment could be discretionary (rather than guaranteed)
      </li>
      <li>
        changes to terms and conditions of future benefits
        <ul>
          <li>
            ─ e.g. accrual rates have been reduced in many final salary schemes and others have switched to DC. how does this help control benefit costs?
          </li>
          <li>
            ─ switching from DB to DC does not, in itself, reduce the cost of benefits (although it reduces the volatility of the cost). however, many employers have taken the opportunity to fix the contribution rate in the DC scheme at a level lower than that likely to be required to cover the previous DB benefits. The cost of managing the scheme will decrease, but this has a marginal effect on the overall cost saved.
          </li>
          <li>
            --e.g. in many countries, State Pension Age is being increased to reduce the cost of the benefits provided. Members paying contribution for longer, the duration they receive the benefits is shorter.
          </li>
        </ul>
