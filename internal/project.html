      What determines the method used by the provider to raise the capital needed will depend
      on a number of factors including
      <ul>
        <li>
          The current demand for various securities from investors.
          <ul>
            <li>For example, in times of high interest rates the issuing of debt will be more expensive as investors
            will require a higher rate of return so equities may be issued instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              The length of duration of the bond will be based on investor appetite.
            </li>
            <li>
              The tax that different instruments are subject to will have an effect.

          </ul>

        <li>
          From the company's perspective the various costs and implications on ways that the running
          of a business will be restricted will come into play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some regulations protecting various investors which may mean that certain ways of raising capital
          will be restricted.
          <ul>
            <li>
              When issuing a debt, the trust deed may restrict furthur funding through debt to protect current debt holders.

    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          A high level preliminary risk analysis to confirm that the project does not obviously have such a high risk profile that it is not worth analysing further.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold a brainstorming session of project experts and senior internal and external people who are used to thinking strategically about the long term.
        </li>
        <li>
          This would involve people that have worked in the areas being considered particularly
        </li>
        <li>
          understanding the risks that are relevant to this project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identify project risks, both likely and unlikely, and upside and downside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discuss identified risks and their interdependency.
        </li>
        <li>
          To help assess interdependency, a thorough categorisation of the risks identified may help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attempt to place a broad initial evaluation on each risk, both for frequency of occurrence and probable consequences if it does occur.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generate initial mitigation options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carry out a desktop analysis to supplement the results from the brainstorming session, by identifying further risks and mitigation options researching similar projects undertaken by the company or others in the past and obtaining the considered opinions of the experts in those locations who are familiar with the details of the project and outline plans for financing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully set out all the identified risks in a risk register, with cross references to other risks where there is interdependency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reasons for minimum capital threshold
          <ul>
            <li>
              Overall, reserves and capital together will contain be designed to ensure the insurance company can withstand adverse circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              This is necessary given the inherent volatility in the claims and other experience of insurance companies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Without this there would be a lack of trust in the industry and insurance companies might fail more regularly leaving policyholders disadvantaged leading to political discontent.
