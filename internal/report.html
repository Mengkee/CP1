      main parties who may be interested in analysing the accounts of a non-life insurance company: (potential) shareholders, current policyholders, potential future policyholders, holders of loan stock, regulators, government, tax authorities, re-insurers, competitors.
      <br>
      The basic accounting concepts:
      <ul>
        <li>
          going concern – company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future
        </li>
        <li>
          accruals – revenue is recognised as it is earned, and costs are recognised as they are incurred
        </li>
        <li>
          consistency – treatment of like items within each accounting period and from one period to the next is consistent
        </li>
        <li>
          prudence – revenue and profits are not anticipated, and a “best-estimate” provision made for all known liabilities ─ note that this is very different from the actuarial notion of prudence.
          <ul>
            <li>
              From an accounting perspective, prudence is often taken to mean that assets (or gains) are not overstated and liabilities (or losses) are not understated.
            </li>
            <li>
              As a result, it was common that the greater the uncertainty in the estimate of future liabilities, the greater the cushion between the value of the reserve shown in the accounts and the “best estimate” of the expected value of the liabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, such margins can be excessive, and, in recent years, there has been a move towards fair value accounting.
            </li>
            <li>
              In principle, this requires that the value placed on the liabilities should reflect the “price” at which the liabilities would be traded between knowledgeable and willing parties (and thus, more appropriately reflecting the level of risk and uncertainty involved).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Hence, unless stated otherwise, the accounts can be considered as a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as a going concern.
      <br>
      Key issues to consider when interpreting company accounts are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          effect of any changes in accounting principles and/or bases ─ if necessary, the previous year’s accounts should be restated on the new basis to allow direct comparison
        </li>
        <li>
          basis used to value assets ─ e.g. market value recognises unrealised capital gains (leaving company vulnerable to fluctuations in market conditions)
        </li>
        <li>
        </li>
        <li>
        effect of any exceptional events during accounting period ─ e.g. merger or acquisition, large single expenditure.
        </li>
        <li>
        </li>
