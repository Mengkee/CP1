      A reserve (or provision) is the amount required to be set aside to meet the promised liabilities in future (allowing for the EPV of any future premiums or contributions).
      <br>
      higher degree of prudence usually required, so as to demonstrate ability to pay promised benefits in all reasonable future circumstances. also, basis often prescribed by legislation.
      <br>
      In general insurance, outstanding claims reserves are usually calculated using a statistical approach or an individual case estimate (where claims are large and infrequent (e.g. marine and aviation insurance). also, where each claim is very heterogeneous (and reserve held needs to reflect individual circumstances).).

    <span id="question_2">Purpose of reserving</span>
    <div id="content">
      <span id="question_2_1">involve reserving on an individual basis</span>
      <br>
      The main reasons for calculating reserves are to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          determine a value for liabilities shown in published accounts
        </li>
        <li>
          demonstrate solvency on a statutory basis
        </li>
        <li>
          determine a value for liabilities to assist with internal business management decisions
          <br>
          ─ required when framing investment strategy and determining discretionary benefit increases (e.g. reversionary bonus for with-profit contracts or increases to pensions in payment)
        </li>
        <li>
          value business in event of merger or acquisition
        </li>
        <li>
          adjust contribution rate required by pension scheme sponsor
        </li>
        <li>
           value the accrued benefits in the event of a pension scheme wind-up
        </li>
      </ul>
      Reserves calculated for the purposes outlined above generally involve aggregating the individual reserves required for each contract (or benefit promise) undertaken.
      <br>

      <br>
      <span id="question_2_2">involve reserving on a global basis</span>
      <br>
      However, it is often necessary to determine additional reserves on a “global” basis to allow for:
      <ul>
        <li>
          risks associated with a mismatching of assets and liabilities
        </li>
        <li>
          the expected costs of any guarantees and options
        </li>
        <li>
          other risks faced by the provider (e.g. credit, operational)
        </li>
        <li>
          credit risk – failure of reinsurer (or other third party). operational risk – mis-selling, fraud.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Reasons for global risk evaluation
      <ul>
        <li>
          (1) Reserves for published accounts
          <br>
          The key requirement here is to follow the relevant legislation and accounting principles.
          <br>
          Accounts will usually be prepared on a going concern basis (i.e. assuming that the company will continue to trade as normal in future).
          <br>
          Alternatively, it may be specified that the accounts are prepared on a break-up basis (i.e. assuming that no new business is written and cover on current policies is terminated immediately).
          <br>
          discount rate should be based on current market conditions (rather than long-term return on assets held), as assets likely to be realised to meet obligations; future expenses may fall (e.g. no further sales and marketing); future withdrawal rates are not relevant
          <br>
          Published accounts are often required to give a true and fair value of the assets and the liabilities. However, in general, there is no universally accepted decision as to what this means.
          <br>
          Most practitioners have interpreted this to mean that, at the very least, a best estimate basis should be used to value the assets and liabilities (i.e. with no significant margins for prudence).
          <br>
          However, some have taken this further and interpreted it as requiring the use of a market-consistent value for the liabilities.
          <br>
          the price that would need to be paid to a counterparty to accept the liabilities in a competitive market (i.e. where there were a large number of potential buyers). however, in practice, such a market does
          not yet exist for insurance company and pension fund liabilities ... although, could we determine such a price if we assume such a market were to exist?
        </li>
        <li>
          (2) Reserves for demonstrating statutory solvency
          <br>
          In practice, the method and assumptions used to demonstrate statutory solvency will often be prescribed by the regulator.
          <br>
          prevents results from being manipulated by changing basis. also, allows objective comparison between different companies (and from year-to-year within the same company)
          <br>
          The key feature of the method and assumptions laid down will be prudence, so that the company can be expected to meet future liabilities in full in all reasonable future circumstances.
          <br>
          For demonstrating statutory solvency, reserves will often be calculated on a break-up basis (as, in the event of insolvency, the company would cease to write new business and existing liabilities will often be bought out by a third party).
          <br>
          Similarly, it is common for assets to be taken at market value for the purposes of demonstrating statutory solvency (and there may also be restrictions of the types of assets included).
          <br>
          Legislation may also prescribe for the calculation of additional reserves covering the other risks faced (e.g. mismatching reserve).
          <br>
          Often, a further cushion will be included by specifying a statutory minimum solvency margin (SMSM) (amount by which value of assets must exceed value of statutory liabilities.)
          <br>
          As well as increasing the security of the promised benefits, this can act as an early warning sign of possible problems ahead.
          <br>
          What might the regulator require of a company that failed to meet the SMSM?
          <br>
          <span class="highlight"> immediate cash injection, stop writing new business, matched investment strategy, forced sale, immediate wind-up and payment of current liabilities.</span>
          <br>
          The size of the SMSM will usually depend on the strength of the reserving basis (i.e. stronger reserving basis → higher statutory reserve → lower SMSM, and vice versa).

        </li>
        <li>
          (3) Reserves for internal business management
          <br>
          Reserves for internal business management will be required to assist with decision making in a number of areas, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              assessing the profitability of current business
            </li>
            <li>
              choosing an appropriate investment strategy
            </li>
            <li>
              setting bonus rates for with-profit contracts
            </li>
            <li>
              determining the level of any discretionary benefits awarded
              <br>
              ─ e.g. a pension scheme surplus may lead to pressure for discretionary increases to pensions in payment, and the effect of this on the security of accrued benefits must be examined
            </li>
            <li>
              exploring the effectiveness of reinsurance arrangements
            </li>
          </ul>
          Then, the reserves will usually be calculated on a best estimate basis (to give a realistic assessment of the effect of the proposed decision on the future financial position).
        </li>
        <li>
          (4) Reserves for valuing benefits in mergers/acquisitions
          <br>
          For mergers and acquisitions, a best estimate basis is usually considered appropriate for valuing the liabilities. as this would usually be considered fair to both buyer and seller.
          <br>
          However, in practice, the relative bargaining power of the two parties involved will also be important
        </li>
        <li>
          (5) Reserves for determining pension contributions
          <br>
          The valuation of a defined-benefit pension fund has two key aims:
          <ul>
            <li>
              to assess the level of funding of the accrued benefits
              <br>
              ─ defined as the ratio of the value of the current assets to the value of the current liabilities
            </li>
            <li>
              to determine an appropriate contribution rate
              <br>
              ─ based on expected cost of benefits accruing in future plus any adjustment for current surplus (or deficit)
            </li>
          </ul>
          In this case, it is reasonable to assume that the scheme will continue as a going concern (unless advised otherwise by the sponsor), and the reserve would be calculated accordingly (i.e. traditionally using a discounted cash flow approach).
          <br>
          However, there will often be a statutory minimum value of the liabilities based on a best estimate of the value of the accrued benefits were the scheme to wind up (or discontinue) immediately with no further benefits accruing.
          <br>
          Why does this represent a sensible statutory minimum value?
          <br>
          the employer always has the option to discontinue the scheme immediately, with no further benefit accrual. however, if the assets held are insufficient to cover the liabilities in this case, then the scheme is technically insolvent.
        </li>
        <li>
          (6) Reserves in the event of a pension scheme wind-up
          <br>
          In this case, a break-up (or discontinuance) basis should be used to value the accrued liabilities, with assets taken at market value.
          <br>
          Thus, current pensions in payment would usually be secured with an insurance company and a “transfer value” paid to current active members and deferred pensioners (reflecting the value of the accrued benefits on withdrawal at the valuation date).
