  <h1>Related to government</h1>

<div class="column side">
The State is the most important player in the provision of benefits. In fact, the State maybe the only
provider or the main provider of benefits.
<br>
Five actions: provide, educate, encourage, compel, regulate

    Aim of the government
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>the government may be taking a paternalistic view.
        </li>
        <li>the government may also be worried that, if citizens do not have sufficient life cover, then
            they will need to provide financial support
        </li>
        <li>the government may want a successful life insurance industry as a source of taxes … and
           jobs for its citizens
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="column middle" >
    Tools at their disposal
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>The first step is for the government to decide whether saving should be encouraged or compelled.
        </li>
        <li>The easiest way would be to compel individuals to do sth.
        </li>
        <li>an information campaign (can argue that it is better than an advertising campaign)
        </li>
        <li>cut any benefits that it provides to those in financial hardship
        </li>
        <li>taxes: contributions made before tax or free of tax accumulations, or increase general tax level
        </li>
        <li>regulation on investments/products…etc
        </li>
        <li>enact laws to make insurer responsible for…
        </li>

    Tools to mitigate the fiscal deficit
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>issuing bonds
        </li>
        <li>issuing Treasury bills

        <li>increasing taxation

    Actions to ensure individuals have the benefits that they need
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Direct provision of benefits. (Often pay as you go)
          <br>
          provide benefits to some or all of the population. Of course, the limiting
          constraint on how much benefit can be provided is the cost that will have to
          be met (at some point) in the form of taxes.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Everyone gets the same benefit. The major advantage is that it is very simple as all people over a certain age
              will get paid the same amount of money.
              <br>
              Similicity leads to smaller administration costs and also reduces the chance of errors. The
              problem is that if the benefit is used in isolation then the system costs a lot of money, as
              both the poor and the rich can get the same amount of retirement income.
            </li>
            <li>
              Means-tested benefit. Under a means tested system benefits are awarded based on the level
              of income people have. In an extreme version people who have high levels of retirement income
              will get no state benefit which in theory allows more money to be awarded to people with no
              other retirement income or the minimum amount can be paid and costs are saved.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  However, it is discouraging people to save, which will lead to lower than predicted savings
                  in the future (as there will be less people with high retirement income and hence less
                  savings than predicted and more dependency on the state than assumed.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  it can be very expensive to run this type of benefits because of extra administration.
                  People will also try to hide their income to get benefits which will again either lead to
                  less savings than predicted or increase running costs as this "fradulent" behaviour which gets
                  investigated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mean-testing can also be viewed as unfair as the high earners will pay most tax during thir lifetime
                  and will get the least benefits.
                </li>
                <li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Subject to eligibility criteria.
              <br>
              It is unfair to have someone who has never worked or never paid any taxes entitled the
              same benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use other benefits in conjunction with retirement benefits.
              <br>
              Another solution is to pay a small pension and then allow people with little
              income to claim other additional benefits.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Education
          <ul>
            <li>
              The State may set out to educate the populace about the benefits of saving for retirement themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hopefully, this will mean that the State has less obligations in the future
              and will also allow people to have a more ideal retirement.
            </li>
