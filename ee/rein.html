          The insurer should start by looking at the financial strength of the reinsurer.
        </li>
        <li>
          The reinsurer’s published accounts and statutory returns would be a good starting point.
        </li>
        <li>
          The insurer should look at the reinsurer’s:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Solvency position, i.e. the level of free assets
            </li>
            <li>
              Types of assets held – match for liabilities, cashflow, volatility, diversification, marketability and liquidity
            </li>
            <li>
              Borrowings – level of gearing, income and asset cover.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The legislative environment in which the reinsurer operates will also affect solvency.
        </li>
        <li>
          The type of business that the reinsurer writes will affect the security of the reinsurer.
        </li>
        <li>
          With regard to the reinsurer’s liabilities, the insurer should look at:
          <ul>
            <li>
              	The diversity by class, geographical region and cedant
            </li>
            <li>
              Exposure to any risk accumulations/catastrophes
            </li>
            <li>
              Any particularly large, unusual or volatile risks covered by the reinsurer
            </li>
            <li>
              The size of the liabilities and future plans for development/expansion
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the reinsurer itself has reinsurance
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The insurer should examine the reputation of the reinsurer, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Its market share
            </li>
            <li>
              Its previous claims history
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability of the management
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the reinsurer has a parent company or is associated with other companies and how financially strong these are
            </li>
            <li>
              Its credit rating
            </li>
            <li>
              The views of others in the industry: other insurers, analysts, the regulator etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      Stochastic modelling techniques are often used to determine an appropriate retention limit.
      Future claims on a particular tranche of business are projected using a stochastic model for the number of claims.
      Then, the optimal retention level can be chosen so as to keep the probability of insolvency (or some other risk measure) below some probability of insolvency (or some other risk measure) below some specified level (based on the current level of the free assets).

      <ul>
        <li>
          the lower the free assets, the greater the need for reinsurance
        </li>
        <li>
          the greater the uncertainty in the future mortality experience, the greater the need for reinsurance
        </li>
        <li>
          lack of relevant past data or poor quality data (e.g. new product or market, changes in underwriting or T&C of policy).
        </li>
      </ul>
      Particularly relevant for small business/new markets

          Reinsurance can reduce regulatory reserves
          <ul>
            <li>
              With reinsurance the direct insurer can pass the liability of extreme events
              over to the reinsurer. As long as teh reinsurer's solvency position is high enough,
              the direct insurer no longer has to reserve for these events and the regulatory capital requirement
              will fall.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Reinsurance can reduce capital strain
          <ul>
            <li>paying the various forms of commission available in treaties such as quota share.
              The burden of initial costs is shared by both the direct insurer and the reinsurer
            </li>
            <li>
              Through the use of financial reinsurance the timings of cash-flows can be altered.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The level of reinsurance is therefore dependent on the level of capital
          <ul>
            <li>
              The  more capital a company has therefore the less reinsurance they will usually
              use so that they can retain more expected profit.
            </li>
          </ul>
