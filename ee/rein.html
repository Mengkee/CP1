      <ul>
        <li>
          The insurer should start by looking at the financial strength of the reinsurer.
        </li>
        <li>
          The reinsurer’s published accounts and statutory returns would be a good starting point.
        </li>
        <li>
          The insurer should look at the reinsurer’s:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Solvency position, i.e. the level of free assets
            </li>
            <li>
              Types of assets held – match for liabilities, cashflow, volatility, diversification, marketability and liquidity
            </li>
            <li>
              Borrowings – level of gearing, income and asset cover.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The legislative environment in which the reinsurer operates will also affect solvency.
        </li>
        <li>
          The type of business that the reinsurer writes will affect the security of the reinsurer.
        </li>
        <li>
          With regard to the reinsurer’s liabilities, the insurer should look at:
          <ul>
            <li>
              	The diversity by class, geographical region and cedant
            </li>
            <li>
              Exposure to any risk accumulations/catastrophes
            </li>
            <li>
              Any particularly large, unusual or volatile risks covered by the reinsurer
            </li>
            <li>
              The size of the liabilities and future plans for development/expansion
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the reinsurer itself has reinsurance
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The insurer should examine the reputation of the reinsurer, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Its market share
            </li>
            <li>
              Its previous claims history
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability of the management
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the reinsurer has a parent company or is associated with other companies and how financially strong these are
            </li>
            <li>
              Its credit rating
            </li>
            <li>
              The views of others in the industry: other insurers, analysts, the regulator etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
