    <span id="question_1">Reduce expenses</span>
    <div id="content">
      Expenses comprise of initial commission, underwriting expenses, claim handling expenses,
      investment management expenses, marketing expenses.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduce the underwriting costs. Savings can be passed on to policyholders in the form of lower premiums.
           but it may lead to poorer claim experience, which will negate any reduction in premiums.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement more stringent underwriting procedures. Should lead to lower claims inception rate and, thus, lower premiums.
          <br>
          But, will increase decline rates and lengthen sales processes.
          <br>
          Also, increased cost of underwriting may outweigh any premium reduction as a result of better risk targeting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the commission (only for life products).
        </li>
        <li>
          Decrease marketing expenditure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change to a more cost-saving investment strategy. e.g From positive to negative investment strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce claim handling expenses, but may lead to higher fraudulent claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adopt a clear definition of certain benefits.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="column middle" >
    <span id="question_2">Reduce claim cost</span>
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduce elements of options / guarantees. Reputational risk
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce additional cover
        </li>

  <div class="column middle" >
    <span id="question_3">Others</span>
    <div id="content">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Weaken assumptions used in pricing basis. Particularly with regard to claim inception (and termination) rates.
          <br>
          But, increased risk of pricing assumptions not being borne out in practice, which will result in future losses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce profitability loading.
          <br>
          Expectation of increased volumes offsetting reduced profit per case.
          <br>
          But, elasticity of demand may not be accurately understood and, thus, increases in volume may not be as expected.
          <br>
          Also, need to consider competitor response to lowering premiums, which may limit any expected increase in competitiveness.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
        </li>
        <li>
        </li>
        <li>
          review reinsurance arrangements
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that all possible tax efficiency are exploited.
        </li>
        <li>
          develop new distribution channels that maybe less price-sensitive (direct sales force, tied agents)
        </li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
